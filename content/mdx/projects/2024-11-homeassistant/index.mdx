## the ingredients

So over the years stuff has piled up in my raspberry box which screamed for a new project:

- a raspberry pi 4
- the official touch display
- smart home components like my lights, our music box etc etc

Now all I needed was a problem to solve :-)

## the "problem"

We dont want to look into our smartphone to handle some of the smart things like the lights. And our MagicMirror is just
read only and cannot control the smart things in our home.

HomeAssistant to the rescue. One of the most active projects on github with a lot of activity and support, as well as
integrations for nearly all things smart.

## the helper

Normally it is recommended to install HomeAssistant in a docker environment. This seems overkill for a raspberry where
Ha is the only thing that should be running there.

And my NAS doesnt support docker so how do I install HA on my PI 4 and make it start directly into a UI for controlling
and reading...

Hey, lets ask ChatGPT how do it instead of googling around...

## the instructions
