One of the big trends in 2019 was adding a dark mode to your app or webpage.
Well, this page got one now too.

Switching to a dark theme in [MaterialUI](https://material-ui.com/) is pretty
easy. Just set the property in your theme config like this:

```
createMuiTheme({
  palette: {
    type: 'dark'
  }
})
```

If you change your background and paper colors like I did here you also have to
provide their dark counterparts like this:

```
createMuiTheme({
  palette: {
    background: {
      default: prefersDarkMode ? '#3c3c3c' : '#fcfcfc',
      paper: prefersDarkMode ? '#314152' : '#f1f1f1',
    },
  }
})
```

The hard part is finding the right colors for your dark mode. Just using black
with white text might seem the way to go but when you want to add a little touch
of color and nuance to your page you got to make sure that it's still legible.
Oh, and dont forget a good contrast for the a11y crowd.

The final touch is a themeable favicon, thanks to
[this demo](https://blog.tomayac.com/2019/09/21/prefers-color-scheme-in-svg-favicons-for-dark-mode-icons/).
Requirements are that you use a svg icon and dont care about
[IE11 and such](https://caniuse.com/#feat=link-icon-svg). Then it's just adding
inline styles into your svg using the mediaquery for dark themes:

```
<svg>
  <style>
    ....
    @media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
      ...
    }
  </style>
  ...
</svg>
```

I could make add some fancy toggle to the site for switching between dark and
light mode. But that's for another day...
