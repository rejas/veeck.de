I got another friend named [Tobi](/photos/people?name=tobego) and this IKEA
lampshade was a present from him IF I remember correctly.

It collected a lot of dust and one or two holes during all the moves I made
around. Can't believe this thing lasted 10+ years but now it got finally
replaced. Thx Tobi! Bye Bye Lampshade!
