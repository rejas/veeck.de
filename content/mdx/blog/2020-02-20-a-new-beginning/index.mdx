So this is the refresh, the restart, the rebirth of my page... Took some time
but I made the jump and finally cleaned up. Threw away the old build system
which was based on [gulp](https://gulpjs.com/) with
[assemble.js](https://assemble.io/) as the templating engine.

Now everything is build with [gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) which runs atop
on [react](https://reactjs.org/). All content is now in a more general mdx
format for the pages and yaml for the image galleries. Sprinkled some UI love in
the form of [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/) on top of it, et voila:

**Welcome to veeck.de v6 !**

I won't promise any regular updates or blog posts since I know how unpredictable
life is especially now :-D
