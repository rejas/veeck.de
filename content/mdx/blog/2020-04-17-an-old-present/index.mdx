It has always been hard for me to throw stuff away that somebody gave me as a
present.

For example I got this as an xmas present long ago from my friend
[Tobi](/photos/people?name=tobi). These days no one is using lamps like that
anymore so why keep it?

Maybe I make a series out of it to keep the memories of these present somewhere
safe...
