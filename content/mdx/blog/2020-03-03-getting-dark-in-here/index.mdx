One of the big trends in 2019 was adding a dark mode to your app or webpage. Well, this page got one now too.

Switching to a dark theme in [MaterialUI](https://material-ui.com/) is pretty easy. Just set the property in your theme
config like this:

```
createMuiTheme({
  palette: {
    type: 'dark'
  }
})
```

The hard part is finding the right colors for your dark mode. Just using black with white text might seem the way to go
but when you want to add a little touch of color and nuacne to your page you got to make sure to stil be legible and
have a good contrast.

thanks to its property in

and it
[assemble.js](https://assemble.io/) as the templating engine.
