        <p>Tired of the same old boring computer cases everywhere I decided to get me something special for my PC. So
        when one day I came across <a target="_blank" href="http://www.hardocp.com/article/2002/09/13/rotten_apple">this modification</a>
        of an Apple G4 case fitted to accommodate a standard x86 PC on HardOCP I knew what I wanted. Some expensive
        auctioning at eBay and a lot of drilling later I had a special PC myself. So now I had a Linux-OS running on
        a Windows-platform in an Apple-case. Groovy, baby!</p>
        <p>At that time the specifications were:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>CPU</b>: AMD AthlonXP 2600+</li>

                <li><b>PSU</b>: TSP 420 P4 Ultra Silent TripleFan</li>
                <li><b>Monitor</b>: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.iiyama.com/pages/startseite.asp?0|1|0|0|0|0|0|2|0|1464">Iiyama ProLite E431S-B</a> 17'' TFT </li>

            </ul>
        <p>I tried various graphic cards, including a GeforceTI4200 and a Sapphire Radeon9600XT, all passively
        cooled. But since the AGP-slot of my motherboard doesn't seem to be able to give enough power, I had to
        ditch the latter. I have seen modifications to G4 cases which just stuck everything into the case
        without keeping the old layout. Those are of course not able to open the PC while running, which is the
        coolest effect of the G4 case.</p>

        <p>The size and layout of the motherboard was very crucial to the success of this case-mod.
        The picture on the left shows the area which has to be nearly empty if the board should fit into the
        case. Only very flat components like the chips you see wont touch the optical drive cage or otherwise
        the side-door won't close. Most boards have transistors in that area, which have to be re-soldered. I
        didn't want to take that risk so I was lucky to find this board.</p>
        <p class="clearfix">Although I bought the shortest optical drive I could find (and with another stroke of luck it also was a
        DVD-burner), one of the RAM-holders still had to go, leaving me with 'only' 1 GigaByte of RAM.</p>

            <figcaption>The power supply.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p class="clearfix">What good is a 420 Watt PSU with three silently running fans if one of them sucks the air from the wrong
        side of the case? Nothing, that's how good it would be. But this would have happened, if I installed my PSU
        the way Apple's PSU are installed with the power connectors beneath the fan outlet. So I had to do some more
        cutting to make room for the fan outlet and install the PSU upside-down. Now the third fan (which can be
        seen in the background on the left side of the picture) sucks the hot air right away from the cpu.</p>

            <figcaption>The mainboard with selfmade cover.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p class="clearfix">Another incompatible component was the IO-shield of the G4-case. I once again had to use my old
        companion, the dremel, to cut out a good piece of the backplate. Later I used some spare plastic piece
        to model a new back-plate for my PC. If I find the time, I will color it to match the rest of the case.</p>

            <figcaption>Move over to see it glow.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p class="clearfix">And no case-mod is finished without some lighting inside. So I put three blue leds into the G4 case
            which shine from behind the apple logo to show who really makes the most stylish computer cases. Move
            the cursor over the picture to see how it shines in the dark.</p>
