## my github profile

<github-card class="figure--github" user="rejas"></github-card>

In case you are running chrome or any other modern browser that already supports
[web-components](https://caniuse.com/#search=web%20component) you can see my github card to the left. On github I store
my hobby projects, so feel free to go there and explore, fork or star one of them.

## How unlucky am I?

Ever wondered how unlucky you are when it comes to boss loot? Trying to get that one item from a boss in the mmorpg or
from a loot crate? Also: [React](https://reactjs.org/) is the hot stuff for quite a long time already so why not use a
little project to learn it?

With this little webtool you can get the answer after you input the number of times you already tried. LOTS of data
missing though, only a few items from [World of Warcraft](https://www.worldofwarcraft.com/) are included.

## World of Warcraft RSS Feed

Since their last redesign Blizzard doesnâ€™t provide an RSS feed on their armory-website anymore. They do however offer an
API to access a JSON-encoded activity feed for character and guilds. Since a colleague held a presentation about node.js
and how easy it is to deploy a server-app with it, I took the opportunity to enhance my javascript knowledge and wrote
this JSON-to-RSS-Feed Converter for World-Of-Warcraft:

<WowFeed />

## NSIS Installer Scripts

Some programs I use don't come bundled with an installer. For those I created
[NSIS-Installer](https://nsis.sourceforge.io/Main_Page) scripts to build my own installation binaries. I only keep the
installer here, the scripts can be found in my [github repository](https://github.com/rejas/nsis):

- [Open Hardware Monitor](https://openhardwaremonitor.org) v0.8.0 beta, a free pc-hardware sensor monitor:
  [setup.exe](https://www.dropbox.com/s/wipwpubl1iq79n2/Open%20Hardware%20Monitor%20v0.8.0%20beta%20setup.exe?dl=0)
  (exe, 500 KB)| updated 06.11.2016
- [StaxRip](https://github.com/staxrip/staxrip) v2.0.2.0, a video encoding app:
  [setup.exe](https://www.dropbox.com/s/b7qlb8tpwfl22xy/StaxRip%20v2.0.2.0%20setup.exe?dl=0) (exe, 224 MB) | updated
  21.05.2019

## The Rasterbator

I took the liberty to update the [Rasterbator](https://arje.net/rasterbator) to run on my MacBook Pro. On MacOS it
requires the [Mono-Framework](http://go-mono.com/) to work, under Windows you will need an installed .NET-framework. If
you find a bug or have a comment, please write me an email.

What it does? The Rasterbator creates huge, rasterized, multi-page images from any picture. The rasterized images can be
printed and assembled into extremely cool posters.
