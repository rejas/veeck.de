Google brings the good old
[rss-feed](https://www.golem.de/news/google-chrome-will-rss-zurueck-in-den-browser-bringen-2105-156635.html) back to its
chrome browser so why shouldn't I ?

So from now on you can get informed in your rss reader if something new happens here, be it blog posts or new projects.

You can find the feed [here](https://veeck.de/rss.xml).
