It has always been hard for me to throw stuff away that somebody gave me as a present.

For example I got this as an xmas present long ago from my friend [Tobi](/photos/people?name=tobi). These days no one is
using lamps like that anymore so why keep it?

Maybe I make a series out of it to keep the memories of these present somewhere safe...
