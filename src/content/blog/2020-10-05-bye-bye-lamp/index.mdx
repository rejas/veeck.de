I got another friend named [Tobi](/galleries/people?name=tobego) and this IKEA lampshade was a present from him IF I
remember correctly.

It collected a lot of dust and one or two holes during all the moves I made around. Can't believe this thing lasted 10+
years but now it got finally replaced. Thx Tobi! Bye Bye Lampshade!
