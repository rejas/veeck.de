So, [gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/). is basically dead or shall I rather say: unupgradable.

But this is the problem with all frameworks that rely heavily on plugins. So gatsby went to v5 and now all mdx
dependencies dont work anymore, the config needs to be tweaked, oh and then the plugin that was used for the background
images doesnt play well anymore with the rest... I dont have time for this...

Time to try out the new kid on the block: [astro](https://astro.build/).

In good foresight I moved all my content into mdx files so converting that just needed a few tweaks in the frontmatter
code.
