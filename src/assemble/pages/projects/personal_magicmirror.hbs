        <h2 class="h2">the problem</h2>
        <h3 class="h3">Day 1 - Look what the cat dragged in from the street</h3>
        <p>Found an old monitor from Acer (Model AL1716) in the streets for free. A backup monitor is always
            welcome so I took him home with me.</p>

        <h3 class="h3">Day 2 - Again?</h3>
        <p>Girlfriends asks me in the morning when she is getting ready to work while I can stay in bed
            for another hour what time it is and when the next tram will leave from the nearest station...</p>

        <h3 class="h3">Day 3 - Is this groundhog day?</h3>
        <p>Girlfriends asks me again in the morning what time it is and when the next tram will leave from the nearest
            station. Twice this time because she is in such a hurry...</p>

        <h3 class="h3">Day 99 - Enough is Enough!</h3>
        <p>Girlfriends asks me like everyday in the morning several time what time it is and when the next tram will
            leave from the nearest station...</p>

        <h2 class="h2">the solution</h2>
        <h3 class="h3">Day 100 - Help is on the way</h3>
        <p>I open my regular computer magazine the {{> article-link
            url='https://www.heise.de/ct/ausgabe/2017-6-Raspberry-beschreibt-Spiegel-3636486.html' text='c\'t'}} and
            find an article about on how you can build yourself a magic mirror that is both mirror and display. Powered
            by a RaspberryPI you can show all kinds of information on it like the weather, a clock and even other
            modules since it is open-source. Is there a module for displaying the local transportation system? Yes,
            there is and there is still this old monitor somewhere around here so let's get started.</p>
        <p>Neat, I still have a RaspberryPI Model 1 too so lets format the sd card, install the standard OS and follow
            the instruction on the {{> article-link url='https://magicmirror.builders/' text='projects homepage'}}.
            Another good resource for setting up and installing your raspberry is written by {{> article-link
            url='https://thisdavej.com/beginners-guide-to-installing-node-js-on-a-raspberry-pi/' text='Dave Johnson'}}.
        </p>

        <div class="article__box">
            <p class="article__text">Damn, the installation process won't finish, since the minimum version due to
                performance reasons is a Model 2. The MagicMirror-software is written in javascript and bundled via
                the Electron-app. While this makes it easier for me to hack on it myself, it takes it toll on the
                processing power of the PI.<br>
                But that isn't a crisis but merely an opportunity to buy a brandnew Model 3. So a few days later I have
                a package in the mailbox and the installation process works flawlessly. In the meantime I started to
                assemble...</p>

        <h3 class="h3">Day 101 - A trip to the hardware store</h3>
        <div class="article__box">
            <div class="article__text">
                <p>Okay, so first I get rid of all the plastic covers of the display. What do I need now...</p>
                <ul class="article__list">
                    <li>Simple image frame just large enough for the display to fit into</li>
                    <li>Some semi-transparent, half-reflecting sheet to put on the frame glass</li>
                    <li>A HDMI-DVI converter since the display is so old that it only has VGA or DVI inputs</li>
                    <li>A VESA wall mount</li>
                    <li>Screws and cables</li>
                </ul>

            <p class="article__text">A quick trip to the local hardware store yields a nearly perfectly fitting frame.
                The sheet is ordered on the internet. While I wait for it to arrive, I already start to assemble the
                display into the frame.

        <h3 class="h3">Day 102 - Do it yourself</h3>
        <p>The semi-transparent sheet arrives but damn, attaching it to the glas is mighty difficult and doesn't
            yield the best results if you are living together with cats :-) Put it on my list of "Things to later
            improve": Buy something finished from the shop. Like the paintwork of my
            <a class="article__link" href="personal_g4pc.html">g4pc</a>
            a craftsman can do it a thousand times better in his shop than me in my home.
        </p>

        <h3 class="h3">Day 103 - Don't move!</h3>
        <p>Time to check how expensive this thing will be if I run it 24h nonstop for a year.... Lets see, the pi takes
            around 4W, the monitor 25W, round it up to 30, multiply it with a lot of zeros to get the per year amount.
            Multiply by 0.28cents per kwh... 70 EUR??? Nope, too much, the monitor has to be put in standby if noone is
            near...</p>
        <p>Good thing there is a module for that, the {{> article-link url='https://github.com/alexyak/motiondetector'
            text='motiondetector'}}. The documentation is non-existing but the biggest problem: What camera should I
            use? Should I buy one especially for the pi and which one is working out of the box with this software?
            Let's google for it... Wait, what... the ps3 move camera is working with the pi too and can be plugged just
            into the usb ports? Good thing I have one of these lying around too, this sounds way to good to be true
            (and I didnt play those ps3 move games anyway :-)</p>
        <p>Aaaaand it works right out of the box! Well, if you are not using an old linux kernel where support for it
            was temporarily broken. But with the latest OS and drivers it's not a problem.</p>
        <p>As for the motiondetector, since it is open source, not very well documented and I had the urge to add a
            threshold to the detection, I forked it and made my {{> article-link text='own module'
            url='https://github.com/rejas/MMM-MotionDetector'}} using this config:</p>
        <pre>config: {
            captureIntervalTime: 1000,
            scoreThreshold: 100,
            timeout: 120000
        }</pre>
        <p>So now the monitor gets suspended if no motion is detected for a minute. That puts the energy consumption
        down to less than 1W for the display, leaving a total at 5W. Now the costs of running the mirror are at a
        reasonable level.</p>

        <h3 class="h3">Day 104 - Hanging around</h3>
        <div class="article__box">
            <p class="article__text">So this is how it currently looks like:</p>
            <img class="article__image" src="/img/projects/magicmirror/projMM_04_wall.small.jpg" alt="Hanging on the wall">
        </div>

        <h3 class="h3">Days to come - Listen to me!</h3>
        <p>With the ps3 doing the motion detection, I now turn my eye to voice recognition. How cool would it be if I could
            tell my magicmirror to turn on the music? So, lets see if the ps3 microphone is also working outofthebox.
            Plug it in aaaand...</p>
        <p>Well, it does show up using this command:</p>
        <pre>cat /proc/asound/cards
            0 [ALSA]: bcm2835 - bcm2835 ALSA

        <p>But how do I find out if it actually records? {{> article-link
            url='https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=38&t=15851#p180474' text='NielsMayer'}} has some
            good tips on how to get your mic configured and also wrote this command:</p>

        </pre>
        <p>See that 01% at the end? Yeah, background noise that gets detected! Awesome! With this out of the way the
            next step is to install some modules for the mirror to read and process the voice commands...</p>
